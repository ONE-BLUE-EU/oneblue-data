Support and Help
================

Github issues should not be used as a support forum. Please use `DKAN Discussions <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan/discussions>`_ for questions about the project.

Please seek support in the following ways:

  #. Read the `documentation <https://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and other guides for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. These are also located in the root docs/ directory.
  #. Check that you're on the latest version before reporting an issue.
  #. Check the issue queue for the same or similar issues to the one you're having.
  #. Search for answers and ask questions on `DKAN Discussions <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan/discussions>`_. This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way. Please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but do not attach your entire project for someone else to debug.
  #. Come back and tell the community if a particular solution worked for you or not. You will help people who come after you.

Be patient. DKAN maintainers work full time on projects that support the development of the module and may be slow to respond to discussions depending on work loads.
